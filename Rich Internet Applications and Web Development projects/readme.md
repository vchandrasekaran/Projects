## Academic Interests

I am specialising in Data Management and would love to start my career as a data analyst. I am interested in technologies relating to Databases and the web.  

## Repository Contents

### Lab 4

I initially created the readme file and added the required content and hosted my picture as well in the repo. Later i made my first node.js program. Navigated to the path through the command prompt. Created the json file and edited the contents in it as described. I then created the index.js file and put code to print my name. Later i navigated to the path in the command prompt and used the npm run start and displayed my name on the CLI.
